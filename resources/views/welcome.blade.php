                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program Galakan Pemerkasaan Keselamatan Siber (PGPKS) or 
                                Cyber Security Health Check Programme (CSHCP) is a comprehensive program that implements
                                 cyber security services and solutions to combat increasingly sophisticated cyber threats 
                                 that are in accordance with current and upcoming technologies.
        
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understanding the importance of cyber security aspects
                                 and enabling Malaysia's digital transformation agenda, CyberSecurity Malaysia (CSM) will 
                                 implement the Cyber Security Health Check Program (CSHCP) for Small and Medium Enterprises
                                  (SMEs) as part of our development project under the 12th Malaysia Plan.
        
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSHCP plays a role in assisting and supplementing the 
                                needs of SMEs confronting cyber security challenges through cyber security health checks that 
                                address rising cyber threats in accordance with current and future technological advances.
                                 It is critical for laying a solid foundation for SME cyber security infrastructures and will 
                                 enable the opportunity to mitigate any potential hazards.
                                
                                <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this, MSCMS would want to provide CyberSecurity 
                                Malaysia with a subscription to the Workspace Tools for Cyber Security Health Check Program 
                                (CSHCP). CSM can use these Workspace Tools to administer the program and acquire a summary or 
                                even a thorough picture of the operations' status.
